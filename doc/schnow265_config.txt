*schnow265_config*

This is my config. I will leave some comments here rather than in the lua files directly.


*schnow265_config.health*

This config ships with healthchecks. You can access these by using `:checkhealth schnow265_config`

These check availability of commands and modules since I have copied the same code into multiple configs.


*schnow265_config.lsp*

You can configure LSP servers by editing the file `lua/config/serverconfig.lua`. This allows easy installation and configuration of LSP servers. Syntax highlighting is set to `download_missing = true`.
